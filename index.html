    <h4 class="main">
      The city of Berlin, also known is the capital of Germany, hosts about 3.85
      million people, yet is one of the smallest states in the country.

    <h2 id="titlee">Fashion</h2>
    <h4 class="main">
      If the idea of haute couture or inventive style resonates with you, you'll
      love the fashion scene in Berlin. With the plethora of inventive minds and
      creative souls in the city, just walking the streets of its upscale
      district, <em>Charlottenburg</em>, is sure to inspire you.
    </h4>
    <h5 class="sub">
      <em>*Fun Fact:*</em> Berlin's most fashionable people are often
      stereotyped to wear sunglasses much more often and unnecessarily than
      usual. After all, they do say the eyes are the window to the soul; so that
      begs the question: what are Berliners hiding?

    <h2 id="titleee">Nightlife</h2>
    <h4 class="main">
      If your interests happen to be similar to mine, you'd most definitely
      enjoy the club scene in Berlin. Known to have the best club scene in
      Europe, Berlin hosts some of the most infamous, enthralling, and riveting
      nightclubs. <em>Berghain</em> is a great place to go, of course as long as
      you're of age and of style. People have been known to line up for hours
      just to get in, even with the very real chance of being denied entry.
    </h4>
    <h5 class="sub">
      <em>*Fun Fact:*</em> Club Berghain either simply annoyed or denied entry
      to Elon Musk due to their "PEACE" sign outdoors, which resulted in him not
      being able to get into the infamous nightclub.

    <h2 id="titleeee">Culture</h2>
    <h4 class="main">
      Berlin's culture surrounds mostly art, so if you consider yourself to love
      the arts (<em
        >you likely do if you've made it this far reading my magnificent
        website</em
      >) you'll have plenty to do if and when you visit. Hosting around 180
      museums and 440 galleries, Berlin boasts a plethora of artistic outlets.
    </h4>
    <h5 class="sub">
      <em>*Fun Fact:*</em> Berlin's <em>Museumsinsel</em> is the largest museum
      campus in the world, and also happens to be a UNESCO World Heritage site.
